Some example code from various processes. 

My personal github page is mostly for scratchwork, but I pulled a few complete files together for use with my portfolio page.

* **cruise_price_scraper.py**: Python code to scrape prices from a popular cruise pricing website
* **eia_api_v2_func.R**: A custom API return I created for R because I did not want to use the R library
* **energy_multiprocess.py**: A type-curve fitting program that utilizes multiprocessing to speed up workflow
* **local_task_check.pwsh**: Shell script to check tasks automated off a local machine where necessary vs. server 
* **pdf_scraper.py**: Python code to search through a pdf document and find the relevant page, then extract the table into a pandas dataframe
